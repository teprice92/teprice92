# About Me

Hi, I’m Taylor (@teprice92)

I’m interested in application and full-stack web development. I have years of experience in Java/C++ desktop application development, but looking to expand
on those skills to aid in web development side of things.

I’m currently learning bootstrap, javascript, typescript, html, css and more.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help me gain experience in web development, but would also love to help out with any desktop/python development
projects.

# Skills

- Java (Swing and FX)
