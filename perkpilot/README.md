# PerkPilot

**Travel smarter. Experience more.**

PerkPilot is a mobile-first web app that plans trips around a household's credit card rewards. You enter a destination, dates and travelers; it compares cash fares, award flights, transfer partners, hotel programs and card credits across the household's **American Express Platinum** and **Chase Sapphire Reserve**, then returns three plans you can book: **Maximum Savings**, **Balanced Value** and **Maximum Luxury**.

## What works today

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Trip search (destination or multi-city, dates, ±3 flexible days, travelers, cabin, style) | ✅ |
| Deterministic rewards engine (cents per point, transfers, bonuses, credits, pooling) | ✅ tested |
| Three strategies with a side-by-side comparison and a recommended plan | ✅ |
| Flight, hotel and experience comparison screens | ✅ |
| Day-by-day itinerary with drag-and-drop, map, re-optimization and booking status | ✅ |
| Household rewards wallet (two travelers, cards, AU status, balances, loyalty, elite status) | ✅ |
| Benefits & credit tracker (usage, enrollment, expirations, reminders, rule edits, history) | ✅ |
| Saved trips, available offline | ✅ |
| AI concierge (Claude with verified tools, plus a deterministic fallback) | ✅ |
| Installable PWA with an offline indicator | ✅ |
| Live cash fares — Duffel or Amadeus (opt-in) | ✅ adapters + mocked tests (need your credentials) |
| Cached award availability — Seats.aero (opt-in) | ✅ adapter, merged at route/date/cabin level, labelled "seen in cached search" |
| Live hotel rates — Amadeus (opt-in) | ✅ cash/portal options only; card-program eligibility is never guessed |
| Live destination experiences — Google Places (opt-in) | ✅ prices labelled "estimated", Google attribution |
| Destination photography — Unsplash (opt-in) | ✅ with photographer attribution; generative art otherwise |
| Verified benefits workflow (admin API + audit log + 90-day staleness) | ✅ |

| Multi-city trips (2–4 cities, inter-city legs, per-city hotels and experiences) | ✅ |
| Premium-cabin upgrade analysis | ✅ |
| Household points strategies (pooling, ownership, top-ups, valuation floors, commitments) | ✅ |
| Trip re-optimization with a change diff | ✅ |
| Transfer-bonus monitoring and alerts; credit-reset calendar export (.ics) | ✅ |
| Multi-user authentication | 🧭 single-household sync token today ([docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#authentication)) |

### Honesty rules built in

- **Demo data is always labelled.** Every price shows whether it is *live*, *cached* or a *demo estimate*. Award availability is never shown as confirmed.
- **Card rules are data, not code.** Benefits, transfer ratios and portal rates live in a date-effective rules dataset. Each rule carries a source URL, a last-verified date and a verification status. The starter dataset ships as **unverified**, and sample transfer bonuses are marked **demo**.
- **The AI does no math.** The concierge has to call the deterministic engine for prices, cents per point and benefits, and the system prompt forbids inventing them.
- **Nothing irreversible happens automatically.** PerkPilot never transfers points or books travel. It gives step-by-step instructions and links to verify first.
- **No credentials are stored.** PerkPilot never asks for card numbers or passwords, and keeps only the last 4 characters of a loyalty member number.

## Quick start

Requirements: **Node.js 20.9+** (22 LTS recommended) and npm. PostgreSQL is optional.

```bash
cd perkpilot
npm install            # also runs `prisma generate`
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

With no environment variables set, the app runs in **guest demo mode**: a sample household, labelled sample prices, and the deterministic concierge.

### Optional configuration

| Variable | Enables |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (+ `PERKPILOT_LLM_MODEL`, default `claude-opus-5-5`) | The AI concierge. It uses server-side fallback on refusals. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Loading the rules database from PostgreSQL, and household sync |
| `PERKPILOT_SYNC_TOKEN` | Syncing household data between both travelers' devices (self-hosted) |
| `DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `PERKPILOT_LIVE_FLIGHTS=duffel` | Live cash fares (Duffel) |
| `AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` + `PERKPILOT_LIVE_FLIGHTS=amadeus` and/or `PERKPILOT_LIVE_HOTELS=amadeus` | Live cash fares and/or hotel rates (Amadeus) |
| `SEATS_AERO_API_KEY` + `PERKPILOT_LIVE_AWARDS=seats-aero` | Cached award availability merged into any flight source |
| `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` + `PERKPILOT_LIVE_EXPERIENCES=google-places` | Live destination experiences |
| `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` | Destination photography |
| `PERKPILOT_ADMIN_TOKEN` (+ `DATABASE_URL`) | The rule-verification admin API |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_TILE_URL` | Your own map tile provider (default: OpenStreetMap) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | API rate limit per client (default 30) |

All keys are server-only. Only variables prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` reach the browser, and the only one is the map tile URL.

### Database (optional)

```bash
docker compose up -d db          # local Postgres 16 on :5432
cp .env.example .env             # Prisma CLI reads .env
npm run db:push                  # create tables
npm run db:seed                  # load the starter rules dataset
```

## Calculation rules (summary)

- **Cents per point** = (comparable cash cost − award taxes and fees − unavoidable award-only charges) ÷ points × 100. Implemented in `src/lib/calc/cpp.ts` (integer cents) and tested against the dollar form.
- **Transfers** respect the ratio (for example 1:1, 1:2 or 1000:800), transfer increments, minimum transfers and active bonuses. The optimizer counts the bank points actually transferred.
- **Credits** count only the value you can realistically use. A credit must be in effect on the charge date, match the component, booking channel, merchant tags, minimum nights and prepaid requirement, and be enrolled if enrollment is required. Its remaining balance is tracked per period by a ledger, so a credit is never double counted.
- **Perks** are valued only when guaranteed. Breakfast isn't counted when the rate already includes it. Property credits are discounted by a usefulness factor. Upgrades and early check-in are listed but never counted.
- **Pooling.** Points are combined across household members only when the program's rule says `allowed`, for example Chase UR with one household member. Amex MR is never combined. Unknown rules are treated as not combinable.
- **Opportunity cost.** Points used are valued at the household's own baseline valuations, which are editable. Maximum Savings rejects redemptions below the minimum cents per point.
- **Confidence** comes from data freshness, the data source (live, cached or demo), whether award availability is known, and the verification status of the rules a recommendation relies on. Demo data can never score "high".
