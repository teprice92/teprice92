 * users to verify against the linked official source. Values live in data —
 * never in calculation code — and every entry is date-effective so changes can
 * be recorded by adding a new row with a new `effectiveFrom` instead of editing
 * history. In production, these rows live in Postgres (see prisma/schema.prisma)
 * and are maintained by an admin verification workflow.
